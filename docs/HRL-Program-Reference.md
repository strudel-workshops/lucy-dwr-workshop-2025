## Program Overview

### What is the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program?

The Healthy Rivers and Landscapes (HRL) Program is a voluntary collaborative agreement between state agencies, federal agencies, and water agencies, serving as an alternative Program of Implementation for the Sacramento River, Delta, and Tributaries update to the [Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/) (WQCP).

### Relationship to Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan

- **Alternative Approach**: The HRL Program provides a voluntary, collaborative alternative to traditional regulatory implementation of water quality objectives
- **Program of Implementation**: Serves as the implementation mechanism for achieving water quality objectives in the WQCP update
- **State Water Board Role**: As the regulatory agency, the State Water Resources Control Board will assess the Program in Year 8 to determine whether to continue, modify, or discontinue it based on progress toward Narrative Objectives
- **Integrated Solution**: Combines environmental flows and habitat restoration to achieve water quality conditions that support native fish populations

### Collaborative Governance Model

The Program operates through a multi-tiered governance structure:

1. **Systemwide Governance Committee (SWGC)**: Oversees Program-wide implementation, coordinates across tributaries and Delta
2. **Tributary/Delta Governance Entities**: Manage implementation within their specific geographic areas
3. **Science Committee**: Provides independent scientific advice and tracks ecological outcomes (advisory role)
4. **Participating Parties**: Water agencies, irrigation districts, public utilities, and resource agencies working collaboratively

**Key Principle**: Voluntary agreements with shared responsibility and risk and novel approaches that are more expansive than those that the regulatory agency can independently mandate

### The Comprehensive Approach: Flow + Habitat

The Program combines two complementary strategies:

#### **Environmental Flow Measures**

- **Tributary Flows**: Pulse flows timed to support salmon migration, reduce disease, and activate restored habitats
- **Delta Outflows**: Increased spring flows (January-June) to benefit Delta smelt, longfin smelt, and ecosystem processes
- **Flexible Implementation**: Flow schedules designed with flexibility brackets to adapt to hydrologic conditions and biological needs

#### **Habitat Restoration (Non-Flow Measures)**

- **Spawning Habitat**: Gravel augmentation and channel modifications for Chinook salmon
- **Rearing Habitat**: Side channels, floodplain restoration, and tidal wetlands
- **Fish Passage**: Screening diversions, removing/modifying barriers to access
- **Ecosystem Enhancement**: Predator management, water quality improvements
- **Scale**: Hundreds of acres of habitat restoration across seven tributary systems and the Delta

### Program Duration and Assessment

- **8-Year Term**: Initial implementation period (with potential for continuation)
- **Adaptive Management**: Continuous learning and adjustment based on monitoring and science
- **Triennial Reviews**: Comprehensive synthesis reports in Years 3 and 6
- **Year 8 Decision Point**: State Water Board evaluates using "Green/Yellow/Red" framework:
  - **Green**: Continue Program as designed
  - **Yellow**: Modify Program based on findings
  - **Red**: Discontinue Program

### How Science Informs the Program

The Science Program serves as the foundation for adaptive management:

- **Independent Evaluation**: Science Committee provides objective assessment of ecological outcomes
- **Multi-Scale Monitoring**: Tracks results from individual projects to population-level trends
- **Decision Support**: Uses models and empirical data to predict outcomes and inform choices
- **Transparency**: Open data, peer review, and public reporting ensure accountability

The science doesn't determine Program success alone—Year 8 assessment also considers implementation progress, funding availability, and flow protection. However, scientific findings on whether the Program contributes to Narrative Objectives are a critical component.

### Unique Features

- **"Safe to Fail" Culture**: Encourages innovation and shared risk-taking to advance understanding
- **Collaborative Planning**: Local entities design projects with support from Science Committee
- **Integrated Analysis**: Compares effectiveness across sites and systems to maximize learning
- **Long-Term Vision**: Designed to achieve lasting ecological benefits beyond regulatory compliance
